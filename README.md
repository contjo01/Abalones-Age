# Abalones-Age

The age of abalone (a type of marine snail) is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope, killing or harming the animal. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, such as sex, length, diameter, height, and others will be used to attempt to predict their age using machine learning. Number of rings in Abalone (+1.5 to get age in years).

Abalones is my final version of the project and Project_1 is my first attempt.
